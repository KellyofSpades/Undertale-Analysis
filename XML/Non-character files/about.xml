        <description>We are a small team working to encode and organize the text from the video
            game Undertale so we can analyze the differences between its three routes: Genocide,
            Neutral, and Pacifist. </description>
    </team>
    <purpose>
        <description>We document, analyze, and publish structured data about Undertale — including
            dialogues and battles — using XML/XSLT for clarity and
            structure</description>
    </purpose>
    <process>
        <step id="1">We created and refined an XML schema to represent characters, fights, dialogues and other data.</step>
        <step id="2">To create readable webpages from XML data, we used XSLT + HTML/CSS. (Inserting XSLT/HTML pages as seen in commits.)</step>
        <step id="3">We contributed data: character info, dialogues, battle definitions, plot content, etc., using XML.</step>
        <step id="4">In order to make the website usable and comprehensible, we modifed the styling, layout, navigation, and page structure.</step>
        <step id="5">We updated documentation, correct structure issues, remove deprecated attributes, increase readability and maintainability. (Commits marked "docs changes, removals, schema updates").</step>
        <step id="6">We tested output, repaired issues, improved schema or the layout as needed. In this repetitive process, each commit is a snapshot.</step>
