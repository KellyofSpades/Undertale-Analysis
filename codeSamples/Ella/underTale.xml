        <line>Thank you. Your power awakened me from death.</line>
        <line>My "human soul." My "determination." They were not mine, but YOURS.</line>
        <line>At first, I was so confused. Our plan had failed, hadn't it? Why was I brought back to
            life?</line>
        <line>You. With your guidance. I realized the purpose of my reincarnation. Power.</line>
        <line> Together, we eradicated the enemy and became strong. <stats>HP. ATK. DEF. GOLD. EXP.
                LV.</stats></line>
        <line>Every time a number increases, that feeling... That's me. "Chara."</line>
        <line>Now, we have reached the absolute. There is nothing left for us here. Let us erase
            this pointless world, and move on to the next.</line>
