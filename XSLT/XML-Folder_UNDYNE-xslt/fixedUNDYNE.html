            <h2>Water Fall Bridge</h2>
            <p>Yo.</p>
            <p>Undyne told me to stay away from you</p>
            <p>She said you... you hurt a lot of people.</p>
            <p>...</p>
            <p>But, yo, that's not true, right!</p>
            <p>...</p>
            <p>... yo... Why won't you answer me?</p>
            <p>A... a... and what's with that weird expression...?</p>
            <p>Oh... Oh man...</p>
            <p>(Man, my h-hearts pounding right out of my chest...)</p>
            <p>(...what would Undyne do?)</p>
            <p>(...)</p>
            <p>Yo...</p>
            <p>Y-you'd b-better st-stop r-right where you are...</p>
            <p>Cause if you w-wanna hurt anyone else... you're..</p>
            <p>You're gonna have to get through me, first.</p>
            <p>A...and... and...</p>
            <p>In my way. </p>
            <p> Undyne... You're... You're hurt... </p>
            <p> Hurt? It's nothing.</p>
            <p>Next time, listen when I tell you to leave, okay?</p>
            <p>Undyne... I...</p>
            <p>I'll take care of this!</p>
            <p>Get out of here!</p>
            <p>...heh... "It's nothing"...</p>
            <p>No... s-somehow with just one hit...</p>
            <p> I'm already...</p>
            <p> Already...</p>
            <p>D... damn it...</p>
            <p> Papyrus... Alphys... ASGORE...</p>
            <p>Just like that, I...</p>
            <p> I've failed you.</p>
            <p> ...</p>
            <p> No...</p>
            <p> My body... It feels like it's splitting apart.</p>
            <p> Like any instant... I'll scatter into a million pieces.</p>
            <p> But...</p>
            <p>Deep, deep, in my soul.</p>
            <p>There's a burning feeling I can't describe.</p>
            <p>A burning feeling that WON'T let me die.</p>
            <p>This isn't about monsters anymore, is it?</p>
            <p>If you get past me, you'll...</p>
            <p>You'll destroy them all, won't you?</p>
            <p>Monsters... Humans... Everyone...</p>
            <p>Everone's hopes. Everyone's dreams. Vanquished in an instant.</p>
            <p>But I WON'T let you do that.</p>
            <p>Right now, everyone in the world...</p>
            <p> I can feel their hearts beating as one.</p>
            <p>And we all have ONE goal.</p>
            <p>To defeat YOU.</p>
            <p>Human. No, WHATEVER you are.</p>
            <p>For the sake of the whole world...</p>
            <p>I, UNDYNE, will strike you down!</p>
            <p>You're gonna have to try a little harder than THAT.</p>
            <p> Damn it...</p>
            <p> So even THAT power... It wasn't enough...?</p>
            <p>...</p>
            <p>Heh...</p>
            <p>Heheheh...</p>
            <p>If you...</p>
            <p>If you think I'm gonna give up hope, you're wrong.</p>
            <p>'Cause I've... got my friends behind me.</p>
            <p>Alphys told me that she would watch me fight you...</p>
            <p>And if anything went wrong, she would... evacuate everyone,</p>
            <p> By now she's called ASGORE and told him to absorb the 6 human SOULS.</p>
            <p>And with that power...</p>
            <p>This world will live on...!</p>
