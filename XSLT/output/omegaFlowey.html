               Howdy!
               
               
               
               
               It's me, FLOWEY.
               
               
               
               
               FLOWEY the FLOWER!
               
               
               
               
               I owe you a HUGE thanks.
               
               
               
               
               You really did a number on that old fool.
               
               
               
               
               Without you, I NEVER could have gotten past him.
               
               
               
               
               But now, with YOUR help...
               
               
               
               
               He's DEAD.
               
               
               
               
               And I'VE got the human souls!
               
               
               
               
               Boy!
               
               
               
               
               I've been empty for so long...
               
               
               
               
               It feels great to have a SOUL inside me again.
               
               
               
               
               Mmmm, I can feel them wriggling...
               
               
               
               
               Awww, you're feeling left out, aren't you?
               
               
               
               
               Well, that's just perfect.
               
               
               
               
               After All, I only have six souls.
               
               
               
               
               I still need one more...
               
               
               
               
               Before I become GOD.
               
               
               
               
               And then, with my newfound powers...
