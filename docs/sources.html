        <div class="sceneBox">
            <p>Routes are the playable option the player goes down, each experience is unique and different to each player. Endings change depending on the route played by the player. The "Paths Guide" shows the process to run each possible path.</p>
            <p>The main focus was just on characters who were most notable to certain routes, each character was determined by asking, <strong>"Where are they seen during [Insert Route]?"</strong>, <strong>"Is this interaction exclusive to this route?"</strong>, and <strong>"Does a casual player know this character from basic gameplay? Or do you have to do something to see them?"</strong></p>
