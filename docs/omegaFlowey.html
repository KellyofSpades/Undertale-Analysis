            <p>It's me, FLOWEY.</p>
            <p>FLOWEY the FLOWER!</p>
            <p>I owe you a HUGE thanks.</p>
            <p>You really did a number on that old fool.</p>
            <p>Without you, I NEVER could have gotten past him.</p>
            <p>But now, with YOUR help...</p>
            <p>He's DEAD.</p>
            <p>And I'VE got the human souls!</p>
            <p>Boy!</p>
            <p>I've been empty for so long...</p>
            <p>It feels great to have a SOUL inside me again.</p>
            <p>Mmmm, I can feel them wriggling...</p>
            <p>Awww, you're feeling left out, aren't you?</p>
            <p>Well, that's just perfect.</p>
            <p>After All, I only have six souls.</p>
            <p>I still need one more...</p>
            <p>Before I become GOD.</p>
            <p>And then, with my newfound powers...</p>
            <p>Monsters.</p>
            <p>Humans.</p>
