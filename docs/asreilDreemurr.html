            <p>Finally.</p>

            <p>I was so tired of being a flower.</p>





            <p>Howdy!</p>

            <p>[Player's Name], are you there?</p>

            <p>It's me, your best friend</p>





            <div class="phaseBox">
               <h3>Phase: defaultDemon</h3>

               <p>You know...</p>
               <p>I don't care about destroying this world anymore.</p>
               <p>After I defeat you and gain total control over the timeline...</p>
               <p>I just want to reset everything.</p>
               <p>All your progress... Everyone's memories.</p>
               <p>I'll bring them all back to zero!</p>
               <p>Then we can do everything ALL over again.</p>
               <p>And you know what the best part of all this is?</p>
               <p>You'll DO it.</p>
               <p>And then you'll lose to me again.</p>
               <p>And again.</p>
               <p>And again!!!</p>
               <p>Because you want a "happy ending."</p>
               <p>Because you "love your friends."</p>
               <p>Because you "never give up."</p>
               <p>Isn't that delicious?</p>
               <p>Your "determination." The power that let you get this far...</p>
               <p>It's gonna be your downfall!</p>
               <p>Now, ENOUGH messing around!</p>
               <p>It's time to purge this timeline once and for all!</p>
               <p>...even after that attack, you're still standing in my way...?</p>
               <p>Wow... you really ARE something special.</p>
               <p>But don't get cocky.</p>
               <p>Up until now, I've only been using a fraction of my REAL power!</p>
               <p>Let's see what good your DETERMINATION is against this!!!</p>

               <p>Urah ha ha ha... Behold my TRUE power!</p>
               <p>I can feel it...</p>
               <p>Every time you die, your grip on this world slips away.</p>
               <p>every time you die, your friends forget you a little more.</p>
               <p>Your life will end here, in a world where no one remembers you...</p>
               <p>Still, you're hanging on...?</p>
               <p>That's fine.</p>
               <p>In a few moments, you'll forget everything, too.</p>
               <p>That attitude will serve you well in your next life!</p>
               <p>Ura ha ha...</p>
               <p>Still!?</p>

            <p>I'm so sorry</p>





            <p>I always was a crybaby, wasn't I, [Player's Name]?</p>





            <p>...</p>





            <p>... I know.</p>





            <p>You're not actually [Player's Name], are you?</p>





            <p>[Player's Name] has been gone for a long time.</p>





            <p>...</p>





            <p>Um... what...</p>





            <p>What IS your name?</p>





            <p>...</p>





            <p>"Frisk?"</p>





            <p>That's...</p>





            <p>A nice name.</p>





            <p>...</p>





            <p>Frisk...</p>





            <p>I haven't felt like this for a long time.</p>





            <p>As a flower, I was soulless.</p>





            <p>I lacked the power to love other people.</p>





            <p>However, with everyone's souls inside me...</p>





            <p>I not only have my own compassion back...</p>





            <p>But I can feel every other monster's as well.</p>





            <p>They all care about each other so much.</p>





            <p>And.. they care about you too, Frisk.</p>





            <p>...</p>





            <p>I wish I could tell you how everyone feels about you.</p>





            <p>Papyrus... Sans... Undyne... Alphys...</p>





            <p>... Toriel.</p>





            <p>Monsters are weird.</p>





            <p>Even though they barely know you...</p>





            <p>It feels like they all really love you.</p>





            <p>Haha.</p>





            <p>...</p>





            <p>Frisk... I... I understand if you can' forgive me.</p>





            <p>I understand if you hate me.</p>





            <p>I acted so strange and horrible.</p>





            <p>I hurt you.</p>





            <p>I hurt so many people.</p>





            <p>Friends, family, bystanders...</p>





            <p>There's no excuse for what I've done.</p>




            


            <p>... besides, even if you do forgive me...</p>





            <p>I can't keep these souls inside of me.</p>





            <p>The least I can do is return them.</p>





            <p>But first...</p>





            <p>There's something I have to do.</p>





            <p>Right now, I can feel everyone's hearts beating as one.</p>





            <p>They're all burning with the same desire.</p>





            <p>With everyone's power... With everyone's determination.</p>





            <p>It's time for monsters...</p>





            <p>To finally go free.</p>






            <p>Frisk...</p>





            <p>I have to go now.</p>





            <p>Without the power of everyone's souls...</p>





            <p>I can't keep maintaining this form.</p>





            <p>In a little while...</p>





            <p>I'll turn back into a flower.</p>





            <p>I'll stop being "myself."</p>





            <p>I'll stop being able to feel love again.</p>





            <p>So... Frisk.</p>





            <p>It's best of you just forget about me, OK?</p>





            <p>Just go be with the people who love you.</p>




           



            <p>Frisk...</p>





            <p>You're..;</p>





            <p>You're going to do a great job, OK?</p>





            <p>No matter what you do.</p>





            <p>Everyone will be there for you, okay?</p>





            <p>Well... My time's running out.</p>





            <p>Goodbye.</p>





            <p>By the way...</p>





            <p>Frisk...</p>





            <p>...take care of Mom and Dad for me, OK?</p>
