            <p>well, here's a better question.</p>





            <p>do you wanna have a bad time?</p>





            <p>'cause if you take another step forward...</p>





            <p>you are REALLY not going to like what happens next.</p>

               <p>it's a beautiful day outside.</p>
               <p> birds are singing. flowers are blooming...</p>
               <p> on days like these, kids like you...</p>
               <p> should be burning in hell.</p>

               <p>what? you think im just gonna stand there and take it?</p>
               <p>our reports showed a massive anomaly in the timespace continuum.</p>
               <p>timelines jumping left and right. stopping and starting ...</p>
               <p>until suddenly, everything ends.</p>
               <p>heh heh heh...</p>
               <p>that's your fault. isn't it?</p>
               <p>you can't understand how this feels.</p>
               <p>knowing that one day, without any warning...</p>
               <p>it's all going to be reset.</p>
               <p>look. i gave up trying to go back a long time ago.</p>
               <p>and getting to the surface doesn't appeal anymore, either.</p>
               <p>cause even if we do...</p>
               <p>we'll just end up back here. without any memory of it. right?</p>
               <p>to be blunt...</p>
               <p>it makes it kind of hard to give it my all.</p>
               <p>...or is that just a poor excuse for being lazy...?</p>
               <p> hell if i know</p>
               <p>all i know is... seeing what comes next...</p>
               <p> i can't afford not to care anymore.</p>

               <p> i know you didn't answer me before, but...</p>
               <p> somewhere in there. i can feel it.</p>
               <p> there's a glimmer of a good person inside of you.</p>
               <p> the memory of someone who once wanted to do the right thing.</p>
               <p>someone who, in another time, might have even been...</p>
               <p>a friend?</p>

               <h3>Phase: resolve</h3>
               <p>welp, it was worth a shot.</p>
               <p> guess you like doing things the hard way, huh?</p>
               <p> sounds strange, but before all this i was secretly hoping we could be
                  friends.</p>
               <p> i always thought the anomaly was doing this cause they were unhappy.</p>
               <p>and when they got what they wanted, they would stop all this.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="phaseBox">

               <p> but that's ridiculous, right?</p>
               <p>yeah, you're the type of person who won't EVER be happy.</p>
               <p> you'll keep consuming timelines over and over, until...</p>

               <p> hey.</p>
               <p>take it from me, kid.</p>
               <p> someday...</p>
               <p> you gotta learn when to QUIT.</p>
               <p> and that day's TODAY.</p>
               <p>cause... y'see..</p>
               <p>all this fighting is really tiring me out.</p>
               <p>and if you keep pushing me...</p>
               <p> then i'll be forced to use my special attack.</p>
               <p>yeah, my special attack. sound familiar?</p>
               <p>well, get ready. cause after the next move, i'm going to use it.</p>
               <p>so, if you don't wanna see it, now would be a good time to die.</p>
               <p>well, here goes nothing...</p>
               <p>are you ready?</p>
               <p>survive THIS, and i'll show you my special attack!</p>

               <p>all right. that's it.</p>
               <p> it's time for my special attack.</p>
               <p>are you ready?</p>
               <p>here goes nothing.</p>
               <p>yep.</p>
               <p>that's right.</p>
               <p>it's literally nothing.</p>
               <p>and it's not gonna be anything, either.</p>
               <p> heh heh heh... ya get it?</p>
               <p>i know i can't beat you.</p>
               <p> one of your turns...</p>
               <p> you're just gonna kill me.</p>
               <p>so, uh.</p>
               <p>i've decided...</p>
               <p>it's not gonna BE your turn. ever.</p>
               <p>i'm just gonna keep having MY turn until you give up.</p>
               <p>even if it means we have to stand here until the end of time.</p>
               <p> capiche?</p>
               <p>you'll get bored here.</p>
               <p>if you haven't gotten bored already, i mean.</p>
               <p>and then, you'll finally quit.</p>
               <p>i know your type.</p>
               <p>you're, uh, very determined, aren't you?</p>
               <p> you'll never give up, even if there's, uh...</p>
               <p>absolutely NO benefit to persevering whatsoever.</p>
               <p> if i can make that clear.</p>
               <p>no matter what, you'll just keep going.</p>
               <p>not out of any desire for good or evil...</p>
               <p> but just because you think you can.</p>
               <p>and because you "can"...</p>
               <p> ...you "have to."</p>
               <p>but now, you've reached the end.</p>
               <p>there is nothing left for you now.</p>
               <p> so, uh, in my personal opinion...</p>
               <p>the most "determined" thing you can do here?</p>
               <p>is to, uh, completely give up.</p>
               <p>and... (yawn) do literally anything else.</p>
               <p> heh, didja really think you would be able</p>
               <p>...</p>
               <p>...</p>
               <p> ...</p>
