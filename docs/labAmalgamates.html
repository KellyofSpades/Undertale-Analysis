            <p>It's the Amalgamate</p>
            <p>You try looking away, but it seems to appear everywhere you look.</p>
            <p>You call the Amalgamate</p>
            <p>It bounds towards you, flecking a strange liquid from an orifice.</p>
            <p>You pet the Amalgamate. It convulses rapidly... Then calms down.</p>
            <p>It rests quietly on your lap for a moment...</p>
            <p>Zzzzz...</p>
            <p>Suddenly, it shoots away and crawls wildly on the walls!</p>
            <p>You throw your weapon into the corner of the room.</p>
            <p>The Amalgamate brings it back to you... Proudly?</p>
            <p>You repeat this process a few times.</p>
            <p>Now Amalgamate is very tired... It leans its dripping, amorphous body on you...</p>
            <p>You pet the Amalgamate. It starts to generate a Stage I Happiness Froth.</p>
            <p>Amalgamate seems too tired to play.</p>
            <p>You pet decisively. The Amalgamate seems to be satisfied by all this.</p>
            <p>Endogeny is contented.</p>
