                <p>Below is a sample collection of Undertale texts from certain key battles in the
                    game. We encoded these texts in XML (chaos-controlled by an agreed upon schema),
                    transformed them with XSLT, and compiled certain sets of data into SVG
                    visuals.</p>

                <p>Undertale Routes are the paths of the game that a player can choose to go down,
                    the "Neutral Route" is the typical playthrough, the player would have to kill
                    and spare all kinds of monsters in order to see this route's ending, the
                    "Pacifist Route" is the usual choice of playthroughs, the player would have to
                    spare every single monster they come across, random encounters to bosses,
                    certain side quests become available in this route to show the monster's bonds
                    with other monsters or even the player, this route has a different ending
                    compared to the Neutral Route. Finally, the "Genocide Route" is another popular
                    route to choose, but due to its difficulty, it's clear why this path is
                    typically avoided by casual players, the player would have to kill every monster
                    in the game, random encounters and bosses. As the player goes through, the
                    monsters aknowledge the player's actions and try to stop you from killing
                    everyone.</p>
